 @article{Franchi_Lorenzani_2016, title={From a Microscopic to a Macroscopic Model for Alzheimer Disease: Two-Scale Homogenization of the Smoluchowski Equation in Perforated Domains}, volume={26}, ISSN={1432-1467}, url={https://doi.org/10.1007/s00332-016-9288-7}, DOI={10.1007/s00332-016-9288-7}, abstractNote={In this paper, we study the homogenization of a set of Smoluchowski's discrete diffusion-coagulation equations modeling the aggregation and diffusion of $$beta $$-amyloid peptide (A$$beta $$), a process associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease. In particular, we define a periodically perforated domain $$Omega _{epsilon }$$, obtained by removing from the fixed domain $$Omega $$(the cerebral tissue) infinitely many small holes of size $$epsilon $$(the neurons), which support a non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition describing the production of A$$beta $$by the neuron membranes. Then, we prove that, when $$epsilon rightarrow 0$$, the solution of this micromodel two-scale converges to the solution of a macromodel asymptotically consistent with the original one. Indeed, the information given on the microscale by the non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is transferred into a source term appearing in the limiting (homogenized) equations. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the geometric structure of the perforated domain induces a correction in that the scalar diffusion coefficients defined at the microscale are replaced by tensorial quantities.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Nonlinear Science}, author={Franchi, Bruno and Lorenzani, Silvia}, year={2016}, month=jun, pages={717-753}, language={en} }
