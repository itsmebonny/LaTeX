\section{Problem setting}
In this section will be outlined a mathematical description of the problem. It will be divided in the two case under study: the static case and the dynamic case.

\subsection{Static case}
The static case is the simplest one. In this case we have a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $d=2,3$ and a force $f$ acting on it. A Lagrangian description of the problem is considered, where the material coordinates are given by the vector $\bm{X}$ and the deformed state of the solid is given by
\begin{equation}
    \bm{x} = \bm{X} + \bm{u}
\label{eq:deformation}
\end{equation}
where $\bm{u}$ is the displacement field. The model used to describe the linear relation between the stress tensor $\bm{\sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}$ and the strain tensor $\bm{\varepsilon} \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}$ is the linear elasticity model, which is given by
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\sigma} = \bm{C} : \bm{\varepsilon}
\label{eq:linear_elasticity}
\end{equation}
where $\bm{C}$ is the stiffness tensor. The strain tensor is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \nabla \bm{u} + (\nabla \bm{u})^T \right)
\label{eq:strain_tensor}
\end{equation}
and the stress tensor is given by
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\sigma} =  2 \mu \bm{\varepsilon} + \lambda \text{tr}(\bm{\varepsilon}) \bm{I}
\label{eq:stress_tensor}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the shear modulus, $\lambda$ is the Lamé parameter and $\bm{I}$ is the identity matrix. The shear modulus and the Lamé parameter are related to the Young's modulus $E$ and the Poisson's ratio $\nu$ by the relations
\begin{equation}
    \mu = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \lambda = \frac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}
\end{equation}
The boundary \( \partial \Omega \) is divided in two parts: the Dirichlet boundary \( \Gamma_D \) and the Neumann boundary \( \Gamma_N \), where \(\Gamma_D \cup \Gamma_N = \partial \Omega \) and \(\Gamma_D \cap \Gamma_N = \emptyset \). The imposition of the Dirichlet boundary conditions is given by
\begin{equation}
    \bm{u} = \bm{u}_D \quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma_D
\end{equation}
and the imposition of the Neumann boundary conditions is given by
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\sigma} \cdot \bm{n} = \bm{t} \quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma_N
\end{equation}
where \( \bm{n} \) is the outward unit normal to the boundary and \( \bm{t} \) is the traction vector. 
At this point, the problem can be formulated as the set of equations
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        -\nabla \cdot \bm{\sigma} = \bm{f} \quad \text{in} \quad \Omega \\
        \bm{u} = \bm{u}_D \quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma_D \\
        \bm{\sigma} \cdot \bm{n} = \bm{t} \quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma_N
    \end{cases}
\label{eq:static_problem}
\end{equation}
where \( \bm{f} \) is the body force. 
Since in this case \(u_D = 0\), it is possible to select \(V = H^1_0(\Omega)\) as the space of test functions, where \(H^1_0(\Omega)\) is the Sobolev space of functions with square integrable derivatives and zero trace on the boundary. To obtain the weak formulation of the problem, integrate both sides of the equation \eqref{eq:static_problem} by a test function \( \bm{v} \in V \) obtaining 
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega} -\nabla \cdot \bm{\sigma} \cdot \bm{v} \, d\Omega = \int_{\Omega} \bm{f} \cdot \bm{v} \, d\Omega
\end{equation}
and, thanks to the divergence theorem, the equation becomes
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega} \bm{\sigma} : \nabla \bm{v} \, d\Omega = \int_{\Omega} \bm{f} \cdot \bm{v} \, d\Omega + \int_{\Gamma_N} \bm{t} \cdot \bm{v} \, ds.
\end{equation}
The numerical solution of this problem can be obtained by the Finite Element Method (FEM) thanks to the SOFA framework.
