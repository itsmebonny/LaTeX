Neural networks are ubiquitous these days, every field of science or engineering is using them to solve problems in some way. Here will be given a short introduction to their inner workings. 
In its most basic configuration, a neural network is composed of three layers: the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer. The input layer receives the data and pass them to the hidden layer, which is the core of the network. The hidden layer is composed of neurons, which are the basic unit of computation of the network. Each neuron receives the data from the previous layer, applies a (nonlinear) function to it and passes the result to the next layer.
