\section{Introduction}
This report will be dedicated to the study of the problem of finding novel ways to obtain a real-time simulation of a deformable object. There are a lot of challenges regarding this problem and not much existing literature on the topic. The idea is to find a way to incorporate data from simulations into a model that is able to predict the behavior of the object in real-time, knowing information about it from a coarse representation which is faster to compute. In this way it is possible to overcome the approximation error given by a low resolution discretization of the object under study. 

The idea to use data-driven modeling to improve the accuracy of the simulation is a fairly recent one, that took off thanks to the improvements made in the chip making industry. The ability to perform calculations at a speed that was previously unthinkable, allowed for the development of new tools and techniques that are able to handle vast amounts of data. This data can be used to train a model that is able to predict the behavior of a system given some input data. In the case of object deformation, the idea is to find a way to learn the relation between the coarse representation of the object and the fine representation, in order to predict the behavior of the object in real-time.
