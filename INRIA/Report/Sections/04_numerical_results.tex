\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numerical_results}
To verify the performance of the proposed method we test it on a 3D problem. The reference geometry is a beam  with a square cross-section of size $1 \times 1$ and a length of $10$. The beam is clamped at one end and free at the other. The material properties are set to $E = 4e8$ and $\nu = 0.2$. \textcolor{green}{qua bisogna aggiungere un po' di roba}.
