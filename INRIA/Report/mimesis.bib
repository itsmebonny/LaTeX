  abstract = {In the recent years, the domain of fast flow field prediction has been vastly dominated by pixel-based convolutional neural networks. Yet, the recent advent of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have attracted a considerable attention in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) community. In this contribution, we proposed a GCNN structure as a surrogate model for laminar flow prediction around 2D obstacles. Unlike traditional convolution on image pixels, the graph convolution can be directly applied on body-fitted triangular meshes, hence yielding an easy coupling with CFD solvers. The proposed GCNN model is trained over a data set composed of CFD-computed laminar flows around 2,000 random 2D shapes. Accuracy levels are assessed on reconstructed velocity and pressure fields around out-of-training obstacles, and are compared with that of standard U-net architectures, especially in the boundary layer area.},

We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckleyand LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence On uniformly convex problems.},

  abstract = {Effective inclusion of physics-based knowledge into deep neural network models of dynamical systems can greatly improve data efficiency and generalization. Such a-priori knowledge might arise from physical principles (e.g., conservation laws) or from the system's design (e.g., the Jacobian matrix of a robot), even if large portions of the system dynamics remain unknown. We develop a framework to learn dynamics models from trajectory data while incorporating a-priori system knowledge as inductive bias. More specifically, the proposed framework uses physics-based side information to inform the structure of the neural network itself, and to place constraints on the values of the outputs and the internal states of the model. It represents the system's vector field as a composition of known and unknown functions, the latter of which are parametrized by neural networks. The physics-informed constraints are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method during the model's training. We experimentally demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on a variety of dynamical systems -- including a benchmark suite of robotics environments featuring large state spaces, non-linear dynamics, external forces, contact forces, and control inputs. By exploiting a-priori system knowledge during training, the proposed approach learns to predict the system dynamics two orders of magnitude more accurately than a baseline approach that does not include prior knowledge, given the same training dataset.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Time resolved three-dimensional phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D-Flow MRI) has been used to non-invasively measure blood velocities in the human vascular system. However, issues such as low spatio-temporal resolution, acquisition noise, velocity aliasing, and phase-offset artifacts have hampered its clinical application. In this research, we developed a purely data-driven method for super-resolution and denoising of 4D-Flow MRI. Methods: The flow velocities, pressure, and the MRI image magnitude are modeled as a patient-specific deep neural net (DNN). For training, 4D-Flow MRI images in the complex Cartesian space are used to impose data-fidelity. Physics of fluid flow is imposed through regularization. Creative loss function terms have been introduced to handle noise and super-resolution. The trained patient-specific DNN can be sampled to generate noise-free high-resolution flow images. The proposed method has been implemented using the TensorFlow DNN library and tested on numerical phantoms and validated in-vitro using high-resolution particle image velocitmetry (PIV) and 4D-Flow MRI experiments on transparent models subjected to pulsatile flow conditions. Results: In case of numerical phantoms, we were able to increase spatial resolution by a factor of 100 and temporal resolution by a factor of 5 compared to the simulated 4D-Flow MRI. There is an order of magnitude reduction of velocity normalized root mean square error (vNRMSE). In case of the in-vitro validation tests with PIV as reference, there is similar improvement in spatio-temporal resolution. Although the vNRMSE is reduced by 50\%, the method is unable to negate a systematic bias with respect to the reference PIV that is introduced by the 4D-Flow MRI measurement. Conclusions: This work has demonstrated the feasibility of using the readily available machinery of deep learning to enhance 4D-Flow MRI using a purely data-driven method. Unlike current state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method is agnostic to geometry and boundary conditions and therefore eliminates the need for tedious tasks such as accurate image segmentation for geometry, image registration, and estimation of boundary flow conditions. Arbitrary regions of interest can be selected for processing. This work will lead to user-friendly analysis tools that will enable quantitative hemodynamic analysis of vascular diseases in a clinical setting.},

However, these methods are usually tested at low-resolution settings, and it remains to be seen whether they can scale to the costly high-resolution simulations that we ultimately want to tackle. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches to improve the framework from MeshGraphNets, which demonstrated accurate predictions in a broad range of physical systems. MeshGraphNets relies on a message passing graph neural network to propagate information, and this structure becomes a limiting factor for high-resolution simulations, as equally distant points in space become further apart in graph space. First, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn accurate surrogate dynamics of a high-resolution system on a much coarser mesh, both removing the message passing bottleneck and improving performance; and second, we introduce a hierarchical approach (MultiScale MeshGraphNets) which passes messages on two different resolutions (fine and coarse), significantly improving the accuracy of MeshGraphNets while requiring less computational resources.},

First, most existing PINNs are based on point-wise formulation with fully-connected networks to learn continuous functions, which suffer from poor scalability and hard boundary enforcement. Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the non-convex optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve training efficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. To properly address these challenges, we present a novel discrete PINN framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and variational structure of PDE to solve forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) in a unified manner. The use of a piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the dimension of search space and facilitate training and convergence. Without the need of tuning penalty parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can strictly impose boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward and inverse settings. The flexibility of GCNs is leveraged for irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. The effectiveness and merit of the proposed method are demonstrated over a variety of forward and inverse computational mechanics problems governed by both linear and nonlinear PDEs.},

In many cases, fluid data are generally sparse, incomplete, and possibly noisy. How to enhance spatial resolution and decrease the noise level of flow data is essential and practically useful. Deep learning (DL) techniques have been demonstrated to be effective for super-resolution (SR) tasks, which, however, primarily rely on sufficient HR labels for training. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed DL-based SR solution using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is able to produce HR flow fields from low-resolution (LR) inputs in high-dimensional parameter space. By leveraging the conservation laws and boundary conditions of fluid flows, the CNN-SR model is trained without any HR labels. Moreover, the proposed CNN-SR solution unifies the forward SR and inverse data assimilation for the scenarios where the physics is partially known, e.g., unknown boundary conditions. Several flow SR problems relevant to cardiovascular applications have been studied to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and merit.

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is a cornerstone of the modern aerospace industry, providing important insights through aerodynamic analysis while reducing the need for expensive experiments and tests. A consistent spatial discretization on so-called grids approximates the analytical solution of the partial differential equation with increasing number of discrete points. But computing a rigorous amount of CFD simulations on fine grids can be a daunting task due to the high computational cost involved. Thus, it is of interest to find methods which generate accurate results while keeping computational costs low. This work proofs that machine learning as a post-processing tool is capable of improving the accuracy of coarse grid simulations. The results show that three machine learning models with varying complexity, namely random forest, neural network, and graph neural network, are capable of finding patterns in coarse grid simulations. These patterns are used for a vertex-wise prediction of the discretization error to approximate the field variables of interest of the corresponding fine grid simulation mapped onto the coarse grid. Initial training and testing is performed on the two dimensional RAE2822 airfoil leading to corrected flow fields, improved surface integrals and coefficients, even when shocks are present. Additional tests are performed on the RAE5212 airfoil, showing the generalization limits of the trained models. Finally, the training and prediction is showcased on a three dimensional geometry. The proposed method promises to reduce computational expenses while increasing the accuracy of the coarse grid results which works locally, e.g. it corrects the error for each vertex individually and is therefore not restricted by the number of grid points. The presented results obtained by the machine learning models during post-processing are a promising baseline for more integrated developments, where the models will interact in a dynamic fashion with the flow solver to further improve coarse grid simulations.},

  abstract = {Efficient numerical solvers for sparse linear systems are crucial in science and engineering. One of the fastest methods for solving large-scale sparse linear systems is algebraic multigrid (AMG). The main challenge in the construction of AMG algorithms is the selection of the prolongation operator -- a problem-dependent sparse matrix which governs the multiscale hierarchy of the solver and is critical to its efficiency. Over many years, numerous methods have been developed for this task, and yet there is no known single right answer except in very special cases. Here we propose a framework for learning AMG prolongation operators for linear systems with sparse symmetric positive (semi-) definite matrices. We train a single graph neural network to learn a mapping from an entire class of such matrices to prolongation operators, using an efficient unsupervised loss function. Experiments on a broad class of problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to classical AMG, demonstrating the potential utility of neural networks for developing sparse system solvers.},

  abstract = {The finite element method (FEM) is among the most commonly used numerical methods for solving engineering problems. Due to its computational cost, various ideas have been introduced to reduce computation times, such as domain decomposition, parallel computing, adaptive meshing, and model order reduction. In this paper we present U-Mesh: a data-driven method based on a U-Net architecture that approximates the non-linear relation between a contact force and the displacement field computed by a FEM algorithm. We show that deep learning, one of the latest machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks, can enhance computational mechanics through its ability to encode highly non-linear models in a compact form. Our method is applied to two benchmark examples: a cantilever beam and an L-shape subject to moving punctual loads. A comparison between our method and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is done through the paper. The results show that U-Mesh can perform very fast simulations on various geometries, mesh resolutions and number of input forces with very small errors.},

  abstract = {Real-time simulation of elastic structures is essential in many applications, from computer-guided surgical interventions to interactive design in mechanical engineering. The Finite Element Method is often used as the numerical method of reference for solving the partial differential equations associated with these problems. Yet, deep learning methods have recently shown that they could represent an alternative strategy to solve physics-based problems 1,2,3. In this paper, we propose a solution to simulate hyper-elastic materials using a data-driven approach, where a neural network is trained to learn the non-linear relationship between boundary conditions and the resulting displacement field. We also introduce a method to guarantee the validity of the solution. In total, we present three contributions: an optimized data set generation algorithm based on modal analysis, a physics-informed loss function, and a Hybrid Newton-Raphson algorithm. The method is applied to two benchmarks: a cantilever beam and a propeller. The results show that our network architecture trained with a limited amount of data can predict the displacement field in less than a millisecond. The predictions on various geometries, topologies, mesh resolutions, and boundary conditions are accurate to a few micrometers for non-linear deformations of several centimeters of amplitude.},

In this context, partial surface matching of non-linear deformable bodies is crucial in engineering to govern structure deformations. In this article, we propose to formulate the registration problem as an optimal control problem using an artificial neural network where the unknown is the surface force distribution that applies to the object and the resulting deformation computed using a hyper-elastic model. The optimization problem is solved using an adjoint method where the hyper-elastic problem is solved using the feed-forward neural network and the adjoint problem is obtained through the backpropagation of the network. Our process improves the computation speed by multiple orders of magnitude while providing acceptable registration errors.},

  abstract = {Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.},

Existing learning-based methods construct subspaces by approximating pre-defined simulation data in a purely geometric way.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach that directly minimizes the system’s mechanical energy during training. We show that our method leads to learned subspaces that reflect physical equilibrium constraints, resolve overfitting issues of previous methods, and offer interpretable latent space parameters.}, note={arXiv:2404.17620 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2404.17620}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Wang, Jiahong and Du, Yinwei and Coros, Stelian and Thomaszewski, Bernhard}, year={2024}, month=apr }

To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.}, note={arXiv:2405.13093 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2405.13093}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Tierz, Alicia and Alfaro, Iciar and González, David and Chinesta, Francisco and Cueto, Elías}, year={2025}, month=jan }

Predicting the compliant modes for a given flexible structure, however, is challenging. While linear eigenmodes capture the small-deformation behavior, they quickly divert into states of unrealistically high energy for larger displacements. Moreover, they are inherently unable to predict nonlinear phenomena such as buckling, stiffening, multistability, and contact. To address this limitation, we propose Nonlinear Compliant Modes—a physically principled extension of linear eigenmodes for large-deformation analysis. Instead of constraining the entire structure to deform along a given eigenmode, our method only prescribes the projection of the system’s state onto the linear mode while all other degrees of freedom follow through energy minimization. We evaluate the potential of our method on a diverse set of flexible structures, ranging from compliant mechanisms to topology-optimized joints and structured materials. As validated through experiments on physical prototypes, our method correctly predicts a broad range of nonlinear effects that linear eigenanalysis fails to capture.}, number={2}, journal={ACM Trans.

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.
