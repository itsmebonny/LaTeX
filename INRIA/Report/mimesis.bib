Yet, the recent advent of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have attracted a considerable attention in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) community. In this contribution, we proposed a GCNN structure as a surrogate model for laminar flow prediction around 2D obstacles. Unlike traditional convolution on image pixels, the graph convolution can be directly applied on body-fitted triangular meshes, hence yielding an easy coupling with CFD solvers. The proposed GCNN model is trained over a data set composed of CFD-computed laminar flows around 2,000 random 2D shapes. Accuracy levels are assessed on reconstructed velocity and pressure fields around out-of-training obstacles, and are compared with that of standard U-net architectures, especially in the boundary layer area.},

  abstract = {Effective inclusion of physics-based knowledge into deep neural network models of dynamical systems can greatly improve data efficiency and generalization. Such a-priori knowledge might arise from physical principles (e.g., conservation laws) or from the system's design (e.g., the Jacobian matrix of a robot), even if large portions of the system dynamics remain unknown. We develop a framework to learn dynamics models from trajectory data while incorporating a-priori system knowledge as inductive bias. More specifically, the proposed framework uses physics-based side information to inform the structure of the neural network itself, and to place constraints on the values of the outputs and the internal states of the model. It represents the system's vector field as a composition of known and unknown functions, the latter of which are parametrized by neural networks. The physics-informed constraints are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method during the model's training. We experimentally demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on a variety of dynamical systems -- including a benchmark suite of robotics environments featuring large state spaces, non-linear dynamics, external forces, contact forces, and control inputs. By exploiting a-priori system knowledge during training, the proposed approach learns to predict the system dynamics two orders of magnitude more accurately than a baseline approach that does not include prior knowledge, given the same training dataset.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Time resolved three-dimensional phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D-Flow MRI) has been used to non-invasively measure blood velocities in the human vascular system. However, issues such as low spatio-temporal resolution, acquisition noise, velocity aliasing, and phase-offset artifacts have hampered its clinical application. In this research, we developed a purely data-driven method for super-resolution and denoising of 4D-Flow MRI. Methods: The flow velocities, pressure, and the MRI image magnitude are modeled as a patient-specific deep neural net (DNN). For training, 4D-Flow MRI images in the complex Cartesian space are used to impose data-fidelity. Physics of fluid flow is imposed through regularization. Creative loss function terms have been introduced to handle noise and super-resolution. The trained patient-specific DNN can be sampled to generate noise-free high-resolution flow images. The proposed method has been implemented using the TensorFlow DNN library and tested on numerical phantoms and validated in-vitro using high-resolution particle image velocitmetry (PIV) and 4D-Flow MRI experiments on transparent models subjected to pulsatile flow conditions. Results: In case of numerical phantoms, we were able to increase spatial resolution by a factor of 100 and temporal resolution by a factor of 5 compared to the simulated 4D-Flow MRI. There is an order of magnitude reduction of velocity normalized root mean square error (vNRMSE). In case of the in-vitro validation tests with PIV as reference, there is similar improvement in spatio-temporal resolution. Although the vNRMSE is reduced by 50\%, the method is unable to negate a systematic bias with respect to the reference PIV that is introduced by the 4D-Flow MRI measurement. Conclusions: This work has demonstrated the feasibility of using the readily available machinery of deep learning to enhance 4D-Flow MRI using a purely data-driven method. Unlike current state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method is agnostic to geometry and boundary conditions and therefore eliminates the need for tedious tasks such as accurate image segmentation for geometry, image registration, and estimation of boundary flow conditions. Arbitrary regions of interest can be selected for processing. This work will lead to user-friendly analysis tools that will enable quantitative hemodynamic analysis of vascular diseases in a clinical setting.},

However, these methods are usually tested at low-resolution settings, and it remains to be seen whether they can scale to the costly high-resolution simulations that we ultimately want to tackle. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches to improve the framework from MeshGraphNets, which demonstrated accurate predictions in a broad range of physical systems. MeshGraphNets relies on a message passing graph neural network to propagate information, and this structure becomes a limiting factor for high-resolution simulations, as equally distant points in space become further apart in graph space. First, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn accurate surrogate dynamics of a high-resolution system on a much coarser mesh, both removing the message passing bottleneck and improving performance; and second, we introduce a hierarchical approach (MultiScale MeshGraphNets) which passes messages on two different resolutions (fine and coarse), significantly improving the accuracy of MeshGraphNets while requiring less computational resources.},

First, most existing PINNs are based on point-wise formulation with fully-connected networks to learn continuous functions, which suffer from poor scalability and hard boundary enforcement. Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the non-convex optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve training efficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. To properly address these challenges, we present a novel discrete PINN framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and variational structure of PDE to solve forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) in a unified manner. The use of a piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the dimension of search space and facilitate training and convergence. Without the need of tuning penalty parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can strictly impose boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward and inverse settings. The flexibility of GCNs is leveraged for irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. The effectiveness and merit of the proposed method are demonstrated over a variety of forward and inverse computational mechanics problems governed by both linear and nonlinear PDEs.},

In many cases, fluid data are generally sparse, incomplete, and possibly noisy. How to enhance spatial resolution and decrease the noise level of flow data is essential and practically useful. Deep learning (DL) techniques have been demonstrated to be effective for super-resolution (SR) tasks, which, however, primarily rely on sufficient HR labels for training. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed DL-based SR solution using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is able to produce HR flow fields from low-resolution (LR) inputs in high-dimensional parameter space. By leveraging the conservation laws and boundary conditions of fluid flows, the CNN-SR model is trained without any HR labels. Moreover, the proposed CNN-SR solution unifies the forward SR and inverse data assimilation for the scenarios where the physics is partially known, e.g., unknown boundary conditions. Several flow SR problems relevant to cardiovascular applications have been studied to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and merit. Both Gaussian and non-Gaussian MRI noises are investigated to illustrate the denoising capability.},

We introduce an encoder-decoder structure to summarize features and create a compact mesh representation of the system state, to allow the temporal model to operate on a low-dimensional mesh representations in a memory efficient manner. Our method outperforms a competitive GNN baseline on several complex fluid dynamics prediction tasks, from sonic shocks to vascular flow.

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is a cornerstone of the modern aerospace industry, providing important insights through aerodynamic analysis while reducing the need for expensive experiments and tests. A consistent spatial discretization on so-called grids approximates the analytical solution of the partial differential equation with increasing number of discrete points. But computing a rigorous amount of CFD simulations on fine grids can be a daunting task due to the high computational cost involved. Thus, it is of interest to find methods which generate accurate results while keeping computational costs low. This work proofs that machine learning as a post-processing tool is capable of improving the accuracy of coarse grid simulations. The results show that three machine learning models with varying complexity, namely random forest, neural network, and graph neural network, are capable of finding patterns in coarse grid simulations. These patterns are used for a vertex-wise prediction of the discretization error to approximate the field variables of interest of the corresponding fine grid simulation mapped onto the coarse grid. Initial training and testing is performed on the two dimensional RAE2822 airfoil leading to corrected flow fields, improved surface integrals and coefficients, even when shocks are present. Additional tests are performed on the RAE5212 airfoil, showing the generalization limits of the trained models. Finally, the training and prediction is showcased on a three dimensional geometry. The proposed method promises to reduce computational expenses while increasing the accuracy of the coarse grid results which works locally, e.g. it corrects the error for each vertex individually and is therefore not restricted by the number of grid points. The presented results obtained by the machine learning models during post-processing are a promising baseline for more integrated developments, where the models will interact in a dynamic fashion with the flow solver to further improve coarse grid simulations.},

One of the fastest methods for solving large-scale sparse linear systems is algebraic multigrid (AMG). The main challenge in the construction of AMG algorithms is the selection of the prolongation operator -- a problem-dependent sparse matrix which governs the multiscale hierarchy of the solver and is critical to its efficiency. Over many years, numerous methods have been developed for this task, and yet there is no known single right answer except in very special cases. Here we propose a framework for learning AMG prolongation operators for linear systems with sparse symmetric positive (semi-) definite matrices. We train a single graph neural network to learn a mapping from an entire class of such matrices to prolongation operators, using an efficient unsupervised loss function. Experiments on a broad class of problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to classical AMG, demonstrating the potential utility of neural networks for developing sparse system solvers.},

In this paper, we propose a solution to simulate hyper-elastic materials using a data-driven approach, where a neural network is trained to learn the non-linear relationship between boundary conditions and the resulting displacement field. We also introduce a method to guarantee the validity of the solution. In total, we present three contributions: an optimized data set generation algorithm based on modal analysis, a physics-informed loss function, and a Hybrid Newton-Raphson algorithm. The method is applied to two benchmarks: a cantilever beam and a propeller. The results show that our network architecture trained with a limited amount of data can predict the displacement field in less than a millisecond. The predictions on various geometries, topologies, mesh resolutions, and boundary conditions are accurate to a few micrometers for non-linear deformations of several centimeters of amplitude.},

  abstract = {Surface matching usually provides significant deformations that can lead to structural failure due to the lack of physical policy. In this context, partial surface matching of non-linear deformable bodies is crucial in engineering to govern structure deformations. In this article, we propose to formulate the registration problem as an optimal control problem using an artificial neural network where the unknown is the surface force distribution that applies to the object and the resulting deformation computed using a hyper-elastic model. The optimization problem is solved using an adjoint method where the hyper-elastic problem is solved using the feed-forward neural network and the adjoint problem is obtained through the backpropagation of the network. Our process improves the computation speed by multiple orders of magnitude while providing acceptable registration errors.},

  abstract = {Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.},
