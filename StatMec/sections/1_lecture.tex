\section{Introduction}
Statistical mechanics may be naturally divided into two branches:
\begin{itemize}
    \item equilibrium systems: independent of time,
    \item non-equilibrium systems: evolve in time.
\end{itemize}
Non-equilibrium phenomena are less understood at the moment. A notable exception is offered by the case of diluted gases.
