@article{Allaire_et_al, title={Two-Scale Convergence On Periodic Surfaces And Applications}, abstractNote={This paper is concerned with the homogenization of model problems in periodic porous media when important phenomena occur on the boundaries of the pores. To this end, we generalize the notion of two-scale convergence for sequences of functions which are defined on periodic surfaces. We apply our results to two model problems: the first one is a diffusion equation in a porous medium with a Fourier boundary condition, the second one is a coupled system of diffusion equations inside and on the boundaries of the pores of a porous medium. Key words: homogenization, two-scale convergence, periodic structures, porous medium. 1 Introduction In porous media, there are (at least) two length scales: a microscopic scale (for example, the size of a single pore), and a macroscopic scale (the size of a typical sample of porous media). Quite often, the partial differential equations describing a physical phenomenon are posed at the microscopic level whereas only macroscopic quantities are of interest}, journal={Mathematical Modelling of Flow through Porous Media}, author={Atomique, Commissariat and Damlamian, Alain and Hornung, Ulrich}, year={1995}, month=sep }

abstract = {Second order parabolic equations on Lipschitz domains subject to inhomogeneous Neumann (or, more generally, Robin) boundary conditions are studied. Existence and uniqueness of weak solutions and their continuity up to the boundary of the parabolic cylinder are proved using methods from the theory of integrated semigroups, showing in particular the well-posedness of the abstract Cauchy problem in spaces of continuous functions. Under natural assumptions on the coefficients and the inhomogeneity the solutions are shown to converge to an equilibrium or to be asymptotically almost periodic.},

In particular, we define a periodically perforated domain $$Omega _{epsilon }$$, obtained by removing from the fixed domain $$Omega $$(the cerebral tissue) infinitely many small holes of size $$epsilon $$(the neurons), which support a non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition describing the production of A$$beta $$by the neuron membranes. Then, we prove that, when $$epsilon rightarrow 0$$, the solution of this micromodel two-scale converges to the solution of a macromodel asymptotically consistent with the original one. Indeed, the information given on the microscale by the non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is transferred into a source term appearing in the limiting (homogenized) equations. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the geometric structure of the perforated domain induces a correction in that the scalar diffusion coefficients defined at the microscale are replaced by tensorial quantities.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Nonlinear Science}, author={Franchi, Bruno and Lorenzani, Silvia}, year={2016}, month=jun, pages={717-753}, language={en} }
