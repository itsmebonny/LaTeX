\section{Introduction}
This report is based on the paper \cite{du2019fisherkpp}, in which the authors study the dynamics of a population in a river network.

The idea is to model the population with a reaction-diffusion equation, in this case the Fisher-KPP equation. 

The interesting idea proposed in this paper is the study of the population dynamics sing a graph-based approach. The authors consider a river network as a graph, where the edges of the graph are the rivers and the nodes are the junctions between rivers. This is not the first time that this kind of approach is used, but, according to the authors, the other works in this area are focused on finite graphs.

This work will be divided in the following way
\begin{itemize}
    \item In section \ref{sec:fisher-kpp} we will present the Fisher-KPP equation and its properties.
    \item In section \ref{sec:graph} we will present the graph-based approach used in this paper.
    \item In section \ref{sec:results} we will present the results obtained by the authors.
    \item In section \ref{sec:conclusion} we will present our conclusions.
\end{itemize}
