    \begin{itemize}
        \item This report is based on the paper [1], in which the authors study the dynamics of a population in a river network.
        \item The idea is to model the population with a reaction-diffusion equation, in this case the Fisher-KPP equation. 
        \item The interesting idea proposed in this paper is the study of the population dynamics using a graph-based approach. The authors consider a river network as a graph, where the edges of the graph are the rivers and the nodes are the junctions between rivers. This is not the first time that this kind of approach is used, but, according to the authors, the other works in this area are focused on finite graphs.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Brief recap on the Fisher-KPP equation.
            \item Presentation and main results of the graph-based approach used by the authors.
            \item In depth analysis of the one of the case presented in the paper.
            \item Finally, some conclusions will be drawn.
