    \begin{itemize}
        \item This presentation is based on a paper \footnote{Du, Y., Lou, B., Peng, R. et al. The Fisher-KPP equation over simple graphs: varied persistence states in river networks. J. Math. Biol. 80, 1559-1616 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-020-01474-1} in which the authors study the dynamics of a population in a river network.
        \item The interesting idea proposed in this paper is the study of the evolution of the species using a graph-based approach. 
        \item It will be analyzed what changes when the domain is a graph instead of a continuous domain.
