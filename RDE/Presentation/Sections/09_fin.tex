    The main takeaways from this work are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Working with infinite graphs can lead to interesting results, but \textbf{needs more care} when studying long-time behavior.
        \item This setting is not able to take into account \textbf{heterogeneous environments}, predators, seasonal variations, and other species without changing completely the model.
        \item With this kind of setup is easy to \textbf{study local dynamics at junctions}, thanks to the unbounded length of the branches.
        
    \end{itemize}
